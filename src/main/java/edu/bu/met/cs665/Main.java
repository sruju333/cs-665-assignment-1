 * Description: This class represents a fully automatic beverage vending machine.
 * It displays a menu of available drinks, brews the selected beverage, allows the addition of condiments,
 * and shows the final price. The program continues to operate until the user chooses to exit. It applies
 * core object-oriented programming principles such as abstraction, inheritance, encapsulation, and
 * polymorphism using abstract classes and interfaces, without incorporating design patterns.
